# HWSnake
Test Program For First Year Class OLED Display Shield.

Use this version in the Arduino IDE.  Either copy and paste or download the .ino file.

# Setup
In order to use you will need to install some libraries in the Arduino IDE library manager.
You can access the Library manager from the Tools Menu.

You need to install the 'Adafruit SSD1306' library for the display.
This will pull in the 'Adafruit GFX' library as well automatically.

You also need the 'TimerInterrupt' library by Khoi Hoang for the switch debouncing.
This is the one spelled exactly like above, not one of the others.
